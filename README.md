# mycorrhizal_succession_iceCommunities

This repository contains the custom code to replicate the analyses published in Carteron et al. Mycorrhizal fungi dynamics and drivers after glacier retreat. Preprint: TBD. Published article: TBD.

For this study, we used environmental DNA metabarcoding and measurements of microhabitat characteristics to assess the evolution of mycorrhizal communities during soil development in 46 glacier forelands across the globe.

The data used in this study is available online:  
- Raw sequences from ITS and trnL amplification are deposited at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6620359  
- Filtered data for fungi is deposited at https://datadryad.org/stash/share/ACsdND52MV8uRoytvjz0OjTTFNRYYMG5as6yQGnW6x4
- Environmental table is deposited at [XXX/env.myco.09.02.23.csv].

The scripts are ordered in this way:
- `import.R` (for accessing the data)
- `modeling.R` (for modeling)
- `figure.R` (for the figures)

In this repository, there are in addition the `README.md` (this file) and `sessionInfo.md` for more information about R, package and OS versions.
